App Name: Marob Farm
Type: Livestock Housing & Land Rental Platform
Goal: Build a modern MVP with modular code, clean architecture, and scalable state management.

---

## 🌍 Concept Overview
Marob Farm is a digital marketplace that connects livestock farmers needing space with landowners or facility owners who have livestock housing or farmland available for rent.
It supports short-term and long-term rentals, ensuring flexible options for farmers and passive income for property owners.

## 👥 User Roles
1. Farmer / Renter – Finds, books, and manages rental spaces.
2. Property Owner – Lists available livestock houses or land.
3. Admin – Verifies users, manages listings, ensures platform safety.
4. Local Agent / Verifier – Inspects and verifies listed properties.

## ⚙ MVP Core Functional Features

### 1️⃣ Property Listings
Each listing includes:
- Livestock type (Poultry, Pig, Cattle, Fishery, Goat, Rabbit, etc.)
- Space type: Empty land / Equipped house / Empty house
- Size (m² or number of livestock units)
- Location: city, LGA
- Price per month or season

### 2️⃣ Search & Filter System
Users can filter by:
- Livestock type
- Location
- Price range
- Size (m² or units)
- Available amenities
- Equipped or empty

---

### 3️⃣ Booking & Payment System
- Integration with Paystack for secure payments.
- Flexible payment plans (one-time, installments, or subscription).
- View receipts & payment history.
- Basic booking summary (no contracts yet in MVP).

---

### 4️⃣ User Dashboards
Farmer Dashboard:
- Track current and past rentals.
- View property details.

Property Owner Dashboard:
- Add and manage listings.
- Track bookings and availability.

---

### 5️⃣ Authentication
- Simple email/password login.
- JWT-based authentication (Supabase or custom Node.js auth).

---

## 💬 Communication
- Inquiry form or basic “Contact Owner” request (stored in backend, no live chat yet).

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Frontend | React Native (mobile) + React (web) | Cross-platform UI |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | REST API for data management |
| Database | PostgreSQL / Supabase | Store users, listings, and bookings |
| Storage | Supabase storage or Cloudinary | Store images/videos |
| Payments | Paystack | Secure payments |
| Auth | JWT or Supabase Auth | Login/session management |

## 🧩 State Management (Modern Architecture)

### Use React Query (TanStack Query) for:
- Server-side / remote state (data from backend)
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Payments
  - User profiles
- Handles caching, background refetching, and sync with API.

### Use Zustand for:
- Local / client-side UI state (in-memory)
  - Filters (livestock type, size, price)
  - UI flags (modals, active tab)
  - Temporary booking data
- Lightweight store using hooks with no context boilerplate.

*Combination Architecture:*
Frontend (React/React Native)
├── Zustand store → UI state
└── React Query → API data (listings, bookings)

---

### Example Folder Structure:
src/
├── api/
│   └── listings.ts
├── hooks/
│   └── useListings.ts     # uses React Query
├── store/
│   └── filterStore.ts     # uses Zustand
├── components/
│   ├── ListingCard.tsx
│   ├── FilterBar.tsx
│   └── BookingForm.tsx
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.tsx
│   ├── ListingDetails.tsx
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   └── Login.tsx

## 🔐 Security & Compliance
- HTTPS + JWT tokens
- Role-based access control
- NDPR / GDPR-ready data handling

---

## 💼 Revenue Model
- Commission on rentals (5–10%)
- Optional insurance add-on (later phase)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- AI Smart Recommendations (listings by livestock type & region)
- Insurance Integration
- Farm Record Logs & Analytics
- Agent Verification System
- In-app Messaging
- Map view (Google Maps API)
- Subscription / Premium Model
- Maintenance Marketplace
- Review & Rating System

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Instructions
When generating the code:
- Use React Query for all API fetching and caching logic.
- Use Zustand for UI and client-only states (filters, active components, etc.).
- Scaffold frontend with reusable React components.
- Create modular backend routes for listings, users, and bookings.
- Integrate Paystack in test mode for MVP payments.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
